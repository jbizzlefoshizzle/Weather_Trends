  <h1>Weather Trends by Latitude</h1>

  <p>How can we show that weather gets warmer towards the equator?</p>

For this project, a Python script was created within Pandas in order to visualize the weather of over 500 randomly selected cities all over the world, of varying distances from the equator.

In order to accomplish this, we used the Python library [citipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create representative models of weather.

We sought to examine the possible relationship latitude may have with the following weather parameters:

* Temperature (Fahrenheit)

* Humidity (%)

* Cloudiness (%)

* Wind Speed (mph)
